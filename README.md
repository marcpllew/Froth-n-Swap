## Planning

TinTins/Froth'n Swap

-   user data base

    -   2 tables Users and Beers

-   Users have ability to sign up/log in/log out

-   for 'style's' will need to create specific parametres for each 'style' then add an if statemnet to check if style parameters are true or false for selected choice

    -   have a way to categorise the items (beers) in styles for easier searching based on preference. (for later)

-   a user can trade beers by posting what they have.(these will be added to the data base) these will need to be linked to the user that posted them.

    -   to do this when an item is added it could be linked to user id?

-   Add like(for later)/next/previous buttons to image displayed

-   Have ability to scroll through data base with next and previous buttons

-   a logged in user can scroll through the list of items and and ‘like’ something. this could then check if another user has liked something in this users list and create a match?(for later)

-   users will then be directed to trading page(for later)
